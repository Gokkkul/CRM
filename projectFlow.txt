### 8. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System**
**Features**:
- **Contact Management**: Manage customer contacts and interaction history.
- **Sales Pipeline**: Track leads and opportunities through the sales pipeline.
- **Email Integration**: Send and track emails directly from the CRM.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate sales reports and analyze performance.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like follow-ups and reminders.


Here's a recommended flow for developing your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System project:

### **Step-by-Step Project Flow**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Clearly define all the functional and non-functional requirements for the CRM system.
   - Prioritize the features (e.g., Contact Management, Sales Pipeline, etc.).

2. **System Design**:
   - **Database Schema Design**: Design the schema for MSSQL using Entity-Relationship modeling. Plan tables such as `Contacts`, `Leads`, `Interactions`, `Reports`, etc., and their relationships.
   - **Application Architecture**: Use a modular architecture with Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and TypeORM as the ORM for MSSQL.
   - Plan RESTful APIs for communication between the Angular frontend and Node.js backend.

3. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Initialize Angular and Node.js projects.
   - Configure MSSQL with TypeORM and set up your database connection.

4. **Build Backend APIs**:
   - Create APIs for:
     - **Contact Management**: CRUD operations for customer contacts.
     - **Sales Pipeline**: Managing leads and opportunities.
     - **Email Integration**: API for sending and tracking emails.
     - **Reporting**: Generating reports and retrieving analytics.
     - **Automation**: Triggering scheduled tasks like follow-ups.
   - Use TypeORM to interact with the MSSQL database.

5. **Frontend Development**:
   - Develop reusable components in Angular:
     - **Contact List**: To view and manage customer contacts.
     - **Pipeline Dashboard**: To track leads and opportunities visually.
     - **Email Module**: For sending and viewing email status.
     - **Reports**: For displaying analytics charts and graphs.
   - Integrate APIs to connect with the backend.

6. **Implement Features**:
   - **Contact Management**: Build forms and workflows for managing contacts.
   - **Sales Pipeline**: Create a visual pipeline with drag-and-drop functionality.
   - **Email Integration**: Embed email tools with status tracking.
   - **Reporting**: Use charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) for analytics.
   - **Automation**: Implement cron jobs or similar tasks in Node.js.

7. **Testing**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and APIs.
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Test the application workflow from start to finish.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on a server (e.g., AWS, Azure, or on-premises).
   - Use tools like Docker for containerization and scalability.

9. **Maintenance & Updates**:
   - Monitor application performance and resolve bugs.
   - Add new features based on user feedback.

### **Tips for Development**
- Follow a microservices approach for scalability.
- Use a state management library like NgRx for Angular to manage application state effectively.
- Implement proper logging and error handling in Node.js for debugging.
- Optimize database queries with TypeORM for better performance.
